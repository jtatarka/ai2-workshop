# ðŸ“± Mobile App Workshop

This project is an updated curriculum based on [ChickTech](https://chicktech.org)'s Android App Design & Development workshop.

It starts with a high-level introduction to mobile applications and goes into a few polling questions to get students in the correct mindset for the rest of the workshop. Next, it moves into the basics of using the MIT AI2 follwed by steps to create a simple first application in the IDE. Once students have completed the first app, they've given the opprotunity to download it to their own personal devices.

Finally, if time allows, the workshop introduces some fundamental design topics, including: user experience design, user interface design, wireframing and mockups, and usability testing.
